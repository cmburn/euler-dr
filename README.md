CMake 3.23+ and Ruby 3+ are required to build the project.

If the native version is being built, Vulkan SDK 1.4+ is also required.

I intend to keep this project compatible with PC (Windows, Linux, Mac, *BSD)
and Nintendo Switch via the native backend. Other platforms can be targeted
via the DragonRuby backend.
